                        During his tertianship from 1851 to 1852, which was supervised by Felix Cicaterri,[4] Maguire was elected to succeed Charles H. Stonestreet as the president of Georgetown University in December 1852.[3] Soon thereafter, the Jesuit Superior General confirmed Maguire's election by the board of directors. Maguire officially assumed the office on January 25, 1853. As president, he was well liked by the students, despite having a reputation for being stern.[4] Some students were displeased with the prefect's imposition of discipline and Maguire's declination to overrule him; they staged another uprising, throwing stones and inkwells to break the windows.[8] The rebellion was quickly quashed after a lecture at breakfast the following morning, in which Maguire appealed to the students' sense of honor.[4] Six students were expelled as a result.[9]

                        Maguire promoted dramatic and literary societies among the students.[10] In April 1853, the university was visited by the Catholic intellectual Orestes Brownson,[11] and the commencement of 1854 was attended by Franklin Pierce, the president of the United States.[12] A fire broke out on December 6, 1854, destroying the shed where the tailor and shoemaker worked. The university's vice president noticed the fire during the night and awoke others who prevented it from spreading to the other buildings.[13]

                        Despite the construction of new buildings, a significant increase in the number of students left Georgetown pressed for physical accommodations. Therefore, Maguire sought to erect another building, but these plans were rendered untenable by the Panic of 1857.[10] The economic crisis also made it difficult for the university to hire a sufficient number of faculty.[14] One historian regarded Maguire's tenure as being overall successful.[10] On October 5, 1858, his term came to an end and he was succeeded by John Early.[15]

                        Several improvements were made to the university's facilities during Maguire's presidency. The preparatory division (which later became Georgetown Preparatory School) was separated from Georgetown College in 1851, both to reduce any negative influence of the older students on the younger ones and because the intermixing of ages dissuaded some older students from attending Georgetown's higher education division. The preparatory division was further segregated with the creation of separate housing for the younger students in 1852 and the institution of a separate academic calendar in 1856.[3] This separation was effective in producing a significant increase in the number of college-aged students enrolling.[3]

                        Construction on a separate building for the preparatory division began in June 1854. The five-story building connected the two buildings to its east and west, and contained a playroom, public hall, classrooms, study hall, and dormitory space.[16] More modest than was originally envisioned several years before, the Preparatory Building cost $20,000 and was complete by the commencement of 1855. It was outfitted with new gas lamps, rather than oil lamps. The Preparatory Building was later renamed Maguire Hall.[10]

                        Pastoral work
                        After his first presidency at Georgetown, Maguire was sent to be the pastor at St. Joseph's Church in Baltimore in 1858. His first time engaging in pastoral work, Maguire garnered a reputation as a skilled orator. In 1859, he was transferred to St. Aloysius Church in Washington, D.C., where his renown as a preacher grew, and his sermons caused many Protestants to convert to Catholicism.[15] Maguire left St. Aloysius at the end of 1864 for Frederick, Maryland, from where he traveled as a missionary throughout Maryland and Virginia. This missionary work also produced conversions to Catholicism.[17] One such convert who heard Maguire preach in Virginia was Thomas H. Stack, who later became a Jesuit and the president of Boston College.[18]

                        Maguire became the president of Georgetown University for a second time on January 1, 1866.[19] Replacing John Early,[20] he took office in the aftermath of the American Civil War. Enrollment at the university had declined precipitously during the war, and few students remained by the time Maguire took office.[17] From 1859 to 1861, the number of students dropped from 313 to 17.[21] As a result of the decreased enrollment, the university was left in a precarious financial state. By the end of Maguire's term, the number of students had begun to rebound.[22] Georgetown's physical campus also suffered during the war, which Maguire described as being "nearly ruined."[21] Upon the end of the 1866 academic year in July, he immediately began to repair and expand the buildings that were damaged from being used as barracks and a military hospital by the Union Army.[21] Within three months, the work was complete.[23] To symbolize post-war national unity, Maguire adopted the respective colors of the Union and Confederate Armies, blue and gray, as the school's official colors.[21]

                        Discussions about creating a law school began during Early's presidency but were suspended due to the war. At the suggestion of a future university president, Patrick F. Healy,[24] these discussions resumed and became more concrete by 1869. Eventually, the university's board of directors approved the establishment of Georgetown Law School in March 1870. Maguire desired the law school to be more integrated with the rest of the university than the medical school, which operated largely autonomously. He selected the first six faculty members and announced the creation of the new school at the university commencement in June 1870.[25] The law school's first classes began in October.[26]

                        President Ulysses S. Grant attended the commencement of 1869 and conferred the degrees.[27] That year, the Jesuit scholasticate, which trained Jesuits in their religious formation, was moved from Georgetown to Woodstock, Maryland, becoming the independent Woodstock College.[28] Maguire's health had begun to deteriorate by 1869, and the new provincial superior, Joseph Keller, began considering potential successors, in consultation with the Jesuit superiors in Rome.[29] Maguire's tenure came to an end in July 1870,[17] and John Early was again named as his successor.[30]

                        Later years
                        Following his second presidency of the university, Maguire returned to St. Aloysius Church as the pastor. He preached regularly until retiring from the position in May 1875.[17] He returned to missionary work, preaching in Canada and San Francisco.[31] He resigned these duties when health prevented him from continuing in 1884.[17]

                        In April 1886, Maguire led a retreat on Passion Sunday at Old St. Joseph's Church in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, after having just finished leading a triduum at the Cathedral of the Assumption in Baltimore. On the third day of the retreat, he fell ill and was taken to St. Joseph's Hospital, where he died on April 26, 1886.[32] His requiem mass was held at St. Aloysius Church in Washington, and he was buried at the Jesuit Community Cemetery at Georgetown University.[33]
